Please deploy the system to the vps with the command `deploy-vps.sh`. Monitor the output and identify potential issues.

If I ask you to verify something please do so, and if I tell you the intent of the change also think what could be needed to be reviewed (also, feel free to see recent commit to infer changes)

You can also ssh to the deploy target (`ssh lightsail`) and check the docker instances associated to this project (and potentially related projects)
