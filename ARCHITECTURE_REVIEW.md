# Architecture Review

This repository contains several Telegram bot implementations. The main code resides under the `bot/` directory and in a few root level scripts (e.g. `gpt_whisper_bot.py`, `dev_bot.py`).

## Structure Overview

- **Adapters** – wrappers around third‑party APIs (OpenAI GPT, Notion, Whisper). Example: the `OpenAI` class in `adapters/gpt_adapter.py` provides helper methods for interacting with the ChatGPT API.
- **bot/** – shared utilities for building bots: user validation, message routing and a small `TelegramBot` class for running the polling loop.
- **Bot scripts** – each script (`gpt_whisper_bot.py`, `notes_bot.py`, etc.) assembles handlers and launches the bot by using the utilities above.
- **Docker** – docker-compose files and scripts allow running different bots in containers.

## Strengths

- Use of adapters keeps third‑party logic separate from the bots themselves.
- The `TelegramBot` helper in `bot/bot_common.py` centralises startup logic and scheduled tasks.
- Environment variables are loaded with `python-dotenv`, easing configuration.

## Weaknesses & Potential Improvements

- The project is not organised as a Python package; modules are imported via relative paths which may hinder reuse. Creating a package (e.g. `telegram_bot`) would clarify boundaries and make distribution easier.
- HTTP calls in async handlers use the synchronous `requests` library (e.g. in `adapters/whisper_adapter.py`). These can block the event loop. Switching to an async client such as `httpx.AsyncClient` would avoid potential delays.
- Environment handling and logging setup are repeated across scripts. Consolidating this into a shared configuration module would reduce duplication.
- There are no unit tests or linting configuration. Adding tests for the adapters and bot logic would help catch regressions.
- Some functions maintain state via global variables (e.g. message history in `OpenAI` adapter). Encapsulating this state or using classes more consistently would improve clarity.

## Overall Assessment

The codebase works and is relatively straightforward, but it mixes synchronous and asynchronous patterns and lacks a clear modular packaging. Refactoring into a well-defined package with asynchronous HTTP requests, shared configuration and tests would make the architecture more robust and maintainable.
