- Analyzed CloudWatch ERROR traces from Telegram bots on AWS Lightsail. Identified root cause as unhandled exceptions with no error handlers registered. All 5 bots failed simultaneously, suggesting external API/network issue. Recommended adding error handlers and checking full tracebacks.
- Root cause confirmed: telegram.error.NetworkError (httpx.ReadError) - transient network interruption during get_updates() polling. Bots auto-recovered via built-in retry logic. No code bug, just network hiccup.
- Added NetworkErrorTracker and error handler to bot_common.py. Transient network errors (1-4 in 5 min) log at WARNING. Persistent errors (5+ in 5 min) escalate to ERROR. Non-network errors always ERROR.
