2025-11-14 10:28:07 - Updated timestamp handling to use Argentina timezone (America/Argentina/Buenos_Aires) instead of UTC. Added timezone conversion functions with zoneinfo/pytz fallback support.
2025-11-14 10:30:43 - Refactored timezone handling to use configurable timezone with sensible default (Argentina/GMT-3). Moved common timezone functions to bot/bot_common.py. Timezone can be overridden via TIMEZONE environment variable.
2025-11-14 10:33:47 - Resolved merge conflicts by merging dev into main. Conflicts were in agent.log and gpt_whisper_bot.py - resolved cleanly with all changes from both branches preserved.
2025-01-XX XX:XX:XX - Fixed timezone handling: Added fallback to pytz when ZoneInfo fails due to missing tzdata database (e.g., on Alpine Linux). Catches ZoneInfoNotFoundError and KeyError to ensure bots work on minimal Python environments.
2025-11-14 13:54:06 - Fixed FileNotFoundError when downloading audio files: Added os.makedirs('audio_files', exist_ok=True) to ensure directory exists before writing files in Docker container.
2025-11-14 13:54:06 - Renamed deploy-vps-deploy.sh to deploy-vps.sh for better naming consistency.
